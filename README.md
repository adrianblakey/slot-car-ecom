# The Remora - Slot Car eCom

This repo contains a [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) design, built binaries (bootloader and firmware) and documentation for a slot car brushless motor electronic commutator or "eCom", also known as an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC).

All the intellectual property herein is released under a [creative commons license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/#:~:text=Creative%20Commons%20licenses%20give%20everyone,creative%20work%20under%20copyright%20law.). Under the terms of this license you are free to use everything you find here and make your own eCom from the distributed files. We hope that by doing so we'll stimulate innovation and experimentation. If you have suggestions for improvement please file a bug report and tell us about it. We'll provide some other feedback mechanisms as we go on and build a community. Also a good place to get help is the [ESCape32 slot car discord channel.](https://discord.com/invite/aed6xdSM5Y) ESCape32 is the firmware we have used to flash and test this eCom it's also open source and you'll find it on [github too.](https://github.com/neoxic/ESCape32)

There is nothing stopping you from making your own copies of this eCom, calling it your own and selling it as a finished product. However, if you want to do that we only ask that you negotiate a small royalty payment with us. If it's out there in the marketplace we'll obviously know about it because it's a small world - so just be up front about it. Some income from this effort would help to defray our development costs and any extra income will be put back into the hobby and improving this part.

We also ask that nothing here is used for military purposes. This also applies to the ESCape32 firmware.
