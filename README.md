# The Remora 1 - Slot Car eCom

This repo contains a [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) design, documentation and ancillary artifacts for a slot car brushless motor electronic commutator or "eCom", also known as an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC).

All the intellectual property herein is released under a [creative commons license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/#:~:text=Creative%20Commons%20licenses%20give%20everyone,creative%20work%20under%20copyright%20law.). Under the terms of this license you are free to use everything you find here and make your own eCom from the distributed files. We hope that by doing so we'll stimulate innovation and experimentation. If you have suggestions for improvement please file a bug report and tell us about it. We'll provide some other feedback mechanisms as we go on and build a community. Also a good place to get help is the [ESCape32 slot car discord channel](https://discord.gg/XNwYPM7E). ESCape32 is the firmware we have used to run this eCom it's also open source and you'll find it on [github too.](https://github.com/neoxic/ESCape32)

There is nothing stopping you from making your own copies of this eCom. As a hobbyist, or manufacturer everything is here to help you do that. As a hobbyist and with a bit of effort you can make very small quantities at very reasonable cost.

If you choose to manufactuer the parts and sell them as a finished product we ask that you negotiate a small royalty payment with us. These designs are open but not free - all the intellectual property (IP) in this repo. belongs to us. If you have a product you are selling that's based on our IP and it's out there in the marketplace we'll know about it because it's a small (slot car) world. If you are making and selling our designs please talk to us and be up front about it. We incur some real expenses to create this and we want to continue innovating. To do that requires some income and that comes from making parts from the design and selling them.

You should also know that if you are making and selling parts it's your responsibility to support the people who buy them. We are are more than happy to help you do that if we are receiving some compensation from you. We've been very generous with the amount of information that we have shared publically on this WiKi to make support simpler. If you choose to republish this information you are under obligation of the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/faq/) to acknowledge its source. 

We also ask that nothing here is used for military purposes. This also applies to the ESCape32 firmware.
